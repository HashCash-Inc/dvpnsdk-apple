/// iOS shows a process no other process's log, and macOS refuses its local store to a sandboxed app. One file per
/// process, replaced each time it is written.
///
/// A provider writes its file only after a failure: when its start fails, when its tunnel stops for a reason nobody
/// asked for, and when `TunnelManager` stops it after a start that timed out or never completed a handshake, telling
/// the provider first. Reading the system's store takes about ten seconds on an iPhone, and the system reports a tunnel
/// down only once its stop returns, so an ordinary disconnect or server switch writes no file.
///

/// `<private>` in the file too. Log nothing about the user, and the file carries nothing about the user.
